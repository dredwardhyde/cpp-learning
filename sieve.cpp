//  1.  Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 to n: (2, 3, 4, â€¦, n).
//  2.  Initially, let p equal 2, the first prime number.
//  3.  Starting from p, count up in increments of p and mark each of these numbers
//      greater than p itself in the list. These numbers will be 2p, 3p, 4p, etc.;
//      note that some of them may have already been marked.
//  4.  Find the first number greater than p in the list that is not marked.
//      If there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let p now equal this number
//      (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.
